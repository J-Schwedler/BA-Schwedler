# How-to Execute Analysis script
First, you need to create a folder in your Google Drive in the root directory. The folder name has to be 'BA_Questionaire'. Now paste the six .csv Files containing the results of the surveys into the newly created folder. 
Next, open the Notebook in Google Colab. In the menu on the left, click on the folder-icon (second option from the bottom). In the newly opened menu, click on the folder icon with the small triangle (the german hover-over text is "Drive bereitstellen"). Now follow the steps from the pop-ups. After the access to the Google Drive has been granted, you can execute the code blocks. 

#Troubleshooting 
Sometimes Google Colab isn't able to find the csv files. Restarting the runtime or reloading the website can help in that case. If this doesn't help, try to disconnect the drive and then connect it again.
