I've literally said to people before that I think street signs need to be a more bold color (white sometimes gets missed!) so that they are  harder to miss. Separately, I liked the dark blue highlight for people who are in the street. The streets shown in the videos are much narrower than I am used to (our streets are typically wider), so it made me nervous when seeing people do things like jump over the concrete median on such a narrow street, and so near to ""my"" car, with very little room to spare. The light blue and dark blue highlights over the people jumping over the concrete median made them stand out and were much more noticeable to me.   CHANGE: I think I would change the blue hightlight over all the other vehicles.  All the different highlights were really hard for me to get used to because it made so many more things stand out to me, but the vehicles being highlighted really was too much for me, on top of the other different highlight colors.  Maybe make the vehicles highlighted ONLY when you are in a high-crash type situation, like maybe when you are changing lanes. The cars around you should then be highlighted when you turn your turn signal on, so that you can then make sure you don't hit another car that you might not see when changing lanes.";"I think a large number of people will be jerks and do something in autonomous vehicles that makes it so that they don't pay attention to the road at all. For example, here in the US, we have already had situations where someone got into the back seat of the car and laid down to sleep while their self-driving car was driving down the road. Another news article pointed out that a guy was busy watching pornography while his autonomous car was driving for him.  For someone like ME, however; I think it will change my behavior IF we can get to the point where these types of cars are more safe than human drivers. It will help me to feel more safe. I don't feel like we are at that point yet. I would them be MORE willing to drive longer distances and in situations where I typically don't drive because I feel unsafe (our  busy freeways in my city, would be one example).

I do feel that occasionally the vehicle does over predict pedestrians, especially when there are people walking near highly reflective glass buildings. 
";"I still at times find the detection of street signs coloring a bit too intense as it makes seeing the original sign color hard at a quick glance. I also find the flickering of the intention of pedestrians can be very distracting in certain lighting conditions.
