Either way,  I just wanted to mention it to explain why I chose some of my answers about how the car reacted. "

I still find the pedestrians the most distracting as I don't like how the status between their states can at times flash back and forth as the car tries to anticipate their movement. I did feel the vehicle's acceleration was slower as it felt like the vehicles around me were moving much faster this time. I also felt there were a few instances where the vehicle started to decelerate too soon and then had to slowly creep up to where it should have stopped. That being said, I am starting to feel more trusting of the vehicle's predictions and behaviours."
